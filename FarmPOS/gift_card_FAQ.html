      <span style="color: #627D46; font: 35px Helvetica-Condensed-Bold !important;">As the farm stand has not been open for a few years, what items will be
        for sale?</span><br>
      <span style="font: 25px Helvetica-Condensed !important;">This year we will have six acres in vegetable production (lettuces, beets, carrots, onions, spinach, broccoli, and more), several acres in
        sweet corn production, a tomato greenhouse, strawberries and other
        fruits. We will also be carrying "local" products from other nearby
        artists, farmers, cooks, and others. Of course, we will have our free
        range eggs!</span><br>

      <span style="color: #627D46; font: 35px Helvetica-Condensed-Bold !important;">How does someone redeem a gift card?</span><br>
      <span style="font: 25px Helvetica-Condensed !important;">Bring the gift card to the Ski Hearth Farmstand. We will create an
        account for you and credit the account for the amount of the gift card.
        You are now able to make purchases.</span><br>
    </div><br>
    <div>
      <span style="color: #627D46; font: 35px Helvetica-Condensed-Bold !important;">Can a gift card be used by someone else?</span><br>
      <span style="font: 25px Helvetica-Condensed !important;">Yes and no. If the gift card has not been redeemed, it can be redeemed
        by anyone. Similar to an iTunes gift card, the gift card has a unique
        code on it. Once this code has been redeemed, it is no longer available
        for use. If you receive a gift card and give it to someone else or
        misplace it and someone else finds it, that person can use the gift
        card. Once the gift card has been redeemed and an account created, the
        amount of the gift card is linked to the account and cannot be
        transferred to another person.</span><br>

      <span style="font: 25px Helvetica-Condensed !important;">No, we do not give refunds or cash back when using gift cards.</span><br>
