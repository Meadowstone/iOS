Changelog:
- FI-42
- FIP-7 (+ Ability to edit products)
- FIP-8


Changelog:
- Fixed customer address bug that would display their address on Checkout screen as a set of "None" words

Changelog:
- Changed the welcome screen layout: moved the farm worker login to the bottom right, made it much less prominent
- Added Help button to navigation
- Removed customer balance payments / gift cards if appropriate option is toggled from the backend
- Added a "Welcome <name>. Balance: $<sum>" message for logged in customers at the middle of the navigation bar
- Changed "Enter quantity" to "Enter weight" for pounds
- Reworked the popover of PIN code selection in customer creation controller, made them cover their own numbers and not get in the way

Changelog:
- Improved the logics behind app showing whether there are any updates available or not. Rebound the update date from local device date to server date which should remove the case where "update available" indication is lit right after syncing the data.
- FI-61. Now searching through all product categories insetad of latest selected
- Products that don't have a default price set will now initially redirect to a new controller used to set price
